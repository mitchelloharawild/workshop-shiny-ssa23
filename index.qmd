# Course Overview

This three-hour workshop provides the basics of creating interactive web applications in R using Shiny. It consists of three sessions that cover the basics of creating a user interface (UI), writing server code with reactive programming, and publishing your application.

This workshop is part of the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://statsoc.org.au/)'s [Statistical Computing and Visualisation](https://www.statsoc.org.au/Statistical-Computing-and-Visualisation-Section) Tutorials, and will run online on Monday 1st December 2023 from 9:00AM - 12:30PM AEDT. 

## Learning objectives

-   Learn the basics of Shiny applications
-   Create a simple UI including dashboards
-   Understand reactive programming for Shiny server code
-   Publish applications online with docker and/or [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)

# Preparation

The workshop will cover the basics of creating shiny web applications. There is no need for prior experience in website development or shiny to get the most out of this workshop. Familiarity with writing R code is expected, and being comfortable with using tidyverse packages including dplyr and ggplot2 would be beneficial. If you are unfamiliar with writing R code or using the tidyverse, consider working through the learnr materials here: <https://learnr.numbat.space/>.

A [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account is needed to deploy your app to <https://www.shinyapps.io/> in session 3 (but is not required if you just want to watch this part).

## Required equipment

Just a computer capable of running R and an internet connection! :computer:

This workshop will be run online, so no other equipment is needed.

## Required software

To be able to complete the exercises of this workshop, please make sure to install a suitable IDE (such as RStudio), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages. In order to deploy your app using docker, you will need to install docker from <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/>

-   **Shiny packages and extensions**
    -   shiny, shinythemes, echarts4r
-   **tidyverse packages and friends**
    -   ggplot2, readr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, forcats

Run this code to install the packages if needed:

```{r}
#| eval: false
packages <- c(
  "shiny", "shinythemes", "echarts4r", "dplyr",
  "ggplot2", "readr", "tibble", "tidyr", "stringr", "forcats"
)

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
```
